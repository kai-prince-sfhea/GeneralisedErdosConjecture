# Abstract {.unnumbered}

We follow steps provided by the paper published by [@host2019short], 'A Short Proof of a Conjecture of Erdős Proved by Moreira, Richter and Robertson', as well as using the results provided by [@kra2022infinite], to generalise the proof of Erdős's conjecture for amenable groups. The main result that we aim to prove is: 'every positively dense subset of an amenable group contains the group sumset of $k$ infinite sets for every natural number $k$'.

# Introduction

::: {#thm-GenErdosConjComb}
## [cf. @host2019short, Theorem 1]

Let $(\Group,\cdot)$ be an amenable group. If $A\subseteq G$ has positive density, then there exists infinite subsets $B$ and $C$ of $G$ such that $B\cdot C\subset A$.
:::

::: {#thm-GenErdosConjRel}
## [cf. @host2019short, Proposition 2]

There exists a set of positive density not containing any sumset of positive density and an infinite set.

::: {#thm-GenNErdosConjComb}
## [cf. @kra2022infinite, Theorem 1.1]

Let $(G,\cdot)$ be an amenable group. If $A\subseteq G$ has positive density then, for every $k\in\mathbb{N}$, there are infinite subsets $B_1,...,B_k\subset G$ such that $B_1\cdot\cdots\cdot B_k\subset A$.

# Preliminaries

We will use $\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,...\}$ and $\Identity$ to denote the identity of the group $\Group$.

## Amenable Groups and Actions

Throughout this paper, unless otherwise specified, we will let $(G,\cdot)$ be a second countable discrete group. This also means that the Haar measure of $G$ is the counting measure.

For simplicity of this paper, we will use the alternative and equivalent definition that a group, $\AmenableGroup$, is *amenable* (and second countable) if and only if it has a Følner sequence.

## Topological Dynamics of Group Actions

:::: {#def-ActionDef}

[Embed definition from actions.qmd]
::::

A *topological dynamical system under the action of $\Group$*, denoted $(X,\Group)$, is a compact metric space $X$ that has continuous surjective maps, $(\GroupElement,x)\mapsto \GroupAction{\GroupElement}{x}$, for all $\GroupElement\in\Group$.

Let $x\in X$, $\Folner=(\Folner[N])_{N\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a Følner sequence in $\Gamma$ and $\mu$ a probability measure on $X$. Where $\delta_x$ is the Dirac mass at $x$, if
$$\frac{1}{|\Folner[N]|}\sum_{\GroupElement\in\Folner[N]}\delta_{\GroupAction{\GroupElement}{x}}\underset{\text{weakly*}}{\longrightarrow} \mu \text{ as }N\rightarrow\infty, $$
then we say *$x$ is generic for $\mu$ with respect to $\Folner$* and we denote this with $x\in\text{gen}(\mu,\Phi)$.^[consider tempered separately as the FCP construction only depends on sequential compactness]
